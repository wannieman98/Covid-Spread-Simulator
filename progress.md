# CS225 Final Project Progress
11/18: Created Edge class in edge.h

11/26: We edited Edge class by adding distance between two vertices and setting it as a weight of an edge & created functions in Graph class(referenced from lab_ml). We decided to mark the end of the process by setting a limit on the number of infected people rather than using time. Also added datafile folder which has functions to get the wanted informations for each airports that is either from the whole openflights datasets or from specific country/s. In addition, we have added another function to get the routes between the chosen airports. 

12/06: The unordered_map turned out to be unable to take tuple as hash values thus the preivous typedef Vertex was changed to a class Vertex that acted like a Node that contained information such as IATA and id as well as longtitude and latitude. After that, we made two more hashing tables and functions that allowed us to get the pointer to the vertex with id or IATA which enable us to identify Edge with source Vertex pointer and the destination Vertex pointer. Using these functions and variables, we created a weighted directed Graph that had vertexes as airports in China and all the routes within those airports. Since, occasionally, different airlines had the same routes, we added a variable to Vertex that counts how many times the routes overlapped, which helps us determine the relative size of the airports. In addition, we made a makefile that allowed us to complie the files in the Graph folder as well as clean the executable files. We have implemented bfs function with starting vertex as a parameter that traverses entire graph using queue. 

12/10: created covidSpread class and added constructor where it creates a graph and sets a starting vertex as well as a total_affected to 0. Finished breadth first search algorithm, utilizing unordered map with IATA as a key. Found out that some airports that were present in the airports data sheet did not have any routes, and therefore excluded those airports. Using a print function, we made sure bfs algorithm searched through all the airports with starting airport as a parameter. For the graph visualizing implementation, previously we had the output of the graph showing repeated routes with different airlines. We attempted to create a vector to save the frequency, so that we can eliminate the repeated routes and rather express that as different edge sizes. In addition, we added some error handling functions such as assertEdgeexists and overload ostream operator to print the contents the edges. Completed dijkstra algorithm and added test cases for testing the dijkstra algorithm. We have added the covid simulator function. We added "A*"search algorithm which takes in source and destination as a parameter and returns the shortest distance abd a path taken. We used an unordered_map with vertex* and int(distance to dest) as a heuristic function.  We fixed the error in putting vertex* in vertex* vector in all algorithms. We modified to set IATA as a parameter for all three algorithms. Added test cases for both bfs and A* search algorithm. The covidsimulator functino ran successfully and we added savePNG function that allowed us to visualize the result of the covid simulator function and print out the total number of infected people through the simulation.
